/**
 * Added support to pass multiple cells in this payload.
 * However, typical expected usage is to send 1 (or few) rather than the entire grid.
 * This is because we typically don't share all the cell info with the players to avoid possible explotation.
 * The server should remain the only one that knows hidden information and we should only sync "public" knowledge to clients.
